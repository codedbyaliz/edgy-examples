## Jealous Husbands

Two couples are on one side of the river with a boat. They must travel to the opposite side of the river, but only two people can fit in the boat at once. To further complicate things, the husbands are jealous of each other and will not leave their wife unattended with any other husbands.

Can they cross the river? If so, how? What about if there are more couples?
